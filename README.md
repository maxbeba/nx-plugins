# NX Plugins

Monorepo for my NX workspace plugins.

## Develop
1. Clone the repo
2. Run `nvm use` or use node version as written in `.nvmrc` file.
3. Run `npm install`

> Globally installed node modules are not required, but it makes sense to install the NX Workspace CLI globally by running `npm install nx -g`.
