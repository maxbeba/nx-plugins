# NX Plugins

Monorepo for my NX workspace plugins.

## Supabase Plugin

NX Workspace plugin for supabase local development using the [Supabase CLI](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cli) for local development.  

The plugin abstracts the superbase CLI into nx commands and lets you integrate it seamlessly into your nx workspace workflow.

Please check the documentation at: [libs/supabase/README.md](libs/supabase/README.md)

## Develop
1. Clone the repo
2. Run `nvm use` or use node version as written in `.nvmrc` file.
3. Run `npm install`

> Globally installed node modules are not required, but it makes sense to install the NX Workspace CLI globally by running `npm install nx -g`.
