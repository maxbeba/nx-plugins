# Supabase NX Workspace Plugin

> This plugin relies on the [npm version of Supabase CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/supabase-plugin).  
> Native installations on macOS, Windows, Linux are not tested.

## Getting started

Before working with a local supabase-plugin environment, please make sure that [Docker Desktop](libs/supabase-plugin/README.md) is installed and running. [Supabase CLI](https://supabase-plugin.com/docs/guides/cli) will spin up the database, dashboard and related services locally using docker.

1. Make sure that Docker Desktop is running
2. Run `nx generate @nx-plugins/supabase-plugin:init` to install dependencies
3. Run `nx generate @nx-plugins/supabase-plugin:app` to create the app

> The local development app is always created in `apps/supabase-plugin`. There is currently no option to change the app name as it is generated by Supabase CLI.

## Building

Run `nx build supabase-plugin` to build the library.

## Running unit tests

Run `nx test supabase-plugin` to execute the unit tests via [Jest](https://jestjs.io).
