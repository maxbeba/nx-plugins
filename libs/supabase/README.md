# Supabase NX Workspace Plugin

## Getting started

Before working with a local supabase environment, please make sure that [Docker Desktop](libs/supabase/README.md) is installed and running. [Supabase CLI](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cli) will spin up the database, dashboard and related services locally using docker.

> This plugin is intended to be used with the [npm version of Supabase CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/supabase).  
> Native installations on macOS, Windows, Linux should also work, but are not tested.  
> See the [CLI Docs](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cli) on local dev environment for more info.

## Building

Run `nx build supabase` to build the library.

## Running unit tests

Run `nx test supabase` to execute the unit tests via [Jest](https://jestjs.io).
